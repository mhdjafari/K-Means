    "\n",
    "## Solution: K-Means++\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means++ is an important improvement to the K-Means algorithm that aims to solve the following problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "        How to avoid converging to a suboptimal solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "It was proposed in a 2006 paper by David Arthur and Sergei Vassilvitskii. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike K-Means that selects the centroids randomly, K-Means++ employs a smarter initialization step. It ensures that the selected centroids are distant from one another which resolves the suboptimal convergence issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "This initialization step requires some additional computation. But this drastically reduces the number of times the algorithm needs to be run to find the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-Means++ initialization algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Take one centroid $c_1$, chosen uniformly at random from the dataset.\n",
    "- Take a new center $c_i$, choosing an instance $\\mathbf{x}_i$ with probability: $D(\\mathbf{x}_i)^2$ / $\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{m}{D(\\mathbf{x}_j)}^2$ where $D(\\mathbf{x}_i)$ is the distance between the instance $\\mathbf{x}_i$ and the closest centroid that was already chosen. This probability distribution ensures that instances that are further away from already chosen centroids are much more likely be selected as centroids.\n",
    "- Repeat the previous step until all $k$ centroids have been chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the K-Means++ algorithm is just regular K-Means. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this initialization, the K-Means algorithm is much less likely to converge to a suboptimal solution, so it is possible to reduce n_init considerably. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, this largely compensates for the additional complexity of the initialization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set the initialization to K-Means++, simply set init=\"k-means++\" (this the default setting)."
